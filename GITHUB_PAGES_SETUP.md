## ðŸŽ‰ Repository Successfully Configured!

Your repository is now set up with both production and demo versions:

- **Repository**: https://github.com/Nichk2/geography_ai
- **Live Demo**: https://nichk2.github.io/geography_ai/ (will be available once GitHub Pages is enabled)

## Repository Structure

## Next Steps

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages (Required)

You need to enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings:

1. Go to: https://github.com/Nichk2/geography_ai/settings/pages
2. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions" 
3. The workflow will automatically deploy when you push to the `demo` branch

### 2. Verify GitHub Actions

Check that the deployment workflow runs successfully:
- Go to: https://github.com/Nichk2/geography_ai/actions
- Look for the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
- It should trigger automatically on pushes to the `demo` branch

### 3. Test the Demo

Once GitHub Pages is enabled and the workflow completes:
- Visit: https://nichk2.github.io/geography_ai/
- Test the chat interface with mock responses
- Verify responsive design on different screen sizes
